# Bugs code to model the Cs-137 peak.
## We have 4+1 unknowns, w, A,B, x0, delta_t
# without taking delta_t into consideration, we have modellled the signal as a gaussian
# with number of observed photons follows poisson distribution.

	y[i] ~ dpois(S[i]) # likelihood of the data
    } 
    
    # uniform prior w, A, B, x0
